# Skyrden Core
Bespoke multipurpose Discord bot for use within [Skyrden](discord.gg/skyrden). Maintained by @sirwaffles on Discord

*Most features depend on the [staff hub](https://staff.skyrden.com), and are made solely to support its integration in Discord. Running this bot without access to its API is useless.*

⚠️ **<ins>ARCHIVE NOTE:</ins>** This repo is meant for showcase use only, is not being maintained, has no documentation, and no support will be provided for it. This is **<ins>not</ins>** for other groups to repurpose. I am no longer employed by Skyrden, and cannot speak for the consequences that could come with using our archived systems without permission.
